### Weapon Property

#### Heavy
* Redefined Heavy weapon property as the following:
> A Heavy weapon is unwieldy compared to other weapons. You have Disadvantage on your attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13, and if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.

#### Light
* Redefined Light weapon property as the following:
> When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage, unless that modifier is negative. For example, if you take the Attack action on your turn and have a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other—each of which has the Light property—you can make one attack with each weapon, using your action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action, unless that modifier is negative.

#### Thrown
* Allows you to draw a weapon as a part of the ranged attack
* Redefined Thrown weapon property as the following:
> If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a Dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the Finesse property.
