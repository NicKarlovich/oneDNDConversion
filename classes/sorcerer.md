#### Arcane Apotheosis
* New 20th level feature
* While your Innate sorcery feature is active, you can use 1 metamagic feature per turn without expending a sorcery point on it.

#### Font of Magic
* It no longer costs a BA to convert spell slots to sorcery points
    * although it does still cost a BA to convert sorcery points into spell slots

#### Innate Sorcery
* New level 1 feature
* BA to gain +1 to spell save DCs and advantage on sorcerer spell attacks
* 2x/long rest

#### Metamagic
* Moved from 3rd to 2nd level
* You can change one option when you gain a sorcerer level.

#### Metamagic Options
* Many of the metamagic options were modified:
    * Careful Spell: When a creature you choose to succeed saves, they take no damage instead of half
    * Distant Spell: Increases spell range by 30ft * sorcerer level rather than doubling the spell's range
    * Empowered Spell: No Change
    * Extended Spell: When you extend the spell, you now also have advantage on concentration saving throws to maintain that concentration
    * Heightened Spell: costs 2 sorcery points instead of 3, and it imposes disadvantage on all saves from that spell rather than just the first
    * Quickened Spell: Clarifies that quickened spell does not bypass casting a leveled spell with your action while also casting a leveled spell with your BA.
    * Seeking Spell: Imported from Tasha's; 2 sorcery points to reroll missed spell attack roll, can be used with other options
    * Subtle Spell: Removes need for material components as well, unless component is consumed
    * Transmuted Spell: (1 sorcery point) Imported from Tasha's; change damage type of spell to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder
    * Twinned Spell: Redesigned entirely, developer explanation:
        > The 2014 version was too powerful, since it basically allowed you to cast two spells on the same turn (as in Quickened Spell) and to cast the extra spell with a Sorcery Point discount (for example, a 3rd-level Spell Slot normally costs 5 Sorcery Points, but in Twinned Spell, it cost only 3). The targeting limitation of Twinned Spell failed to contain how overpowered the option was and caused confusion. The new version of Twinned Spell keeps the Sorcery Point discount, with Quickened Spell carrying the extra-spell-on-a-turn weight. This redesign has allowed us to remove the targeting limitation that Twinned Spell had before.
        * New Version: Cost 1-5 sorcery points; When you cast a spell of 1st–5th level that you also cast on your previous turn by expending a Spell Slot, you can fuel this turn’s casting of the spell by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell’s level rather than expending a Spell Slot

#### Sorcerous Restoration
* 20th level feature moved to 5th level and modified
* Used to be regain 4 sorcery points whenever you finish a long rest
* Is now, when you finish a short rest or roll initiative and have no sorcery points remaining, you can regain a number of sorcery points equal to your sorcerer level divided by five (round down)

#### Sorcery Incarnate
* New 7th level feature
* While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast. 
* In addition, if you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

#### Spellcasting
* New sorcerer specific spells Sorcerous Burst and Arcane Eruption
* The number of total prepared spells goes up to 22 from 15 at level 20(matching clerics and druids) for total prepared at one time (although sorcerers aren't prepared casters).
    * Generally over the course of play you will have more spells than a 5e sorcerer
