#### Blessed Strikes
* new 7th level feature
* Replaces in subclass the Divine Strike and Potent Cantrips features typically shown in subclasses
* Grants cleric the ability to choose between them, rather than being restricted based on subclass
    * Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack with a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant (your choice) damage.
    * Potent Spellcasting. You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Divine cantrip.


#### Channel Divinity
* Get 2 uses at level 2, 3 at level 6 and 4 at level 18
* But you only regain 1 use on short rest rather than all users
* You also can regain all on long rest
* Now grants 2 options to users along with subclass options
    * Divine Spark: As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at them. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant (your choice) damage equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).
    * Turn Undead:
        * Essentially the same as before except instead of undead creatures becoming turned on fail, they instead become incapacitated and frightened until they take damage or caster becomes incapacitated, or dies.

#### Commune
* New 9th level feature
* You always have the commune spell prepared

#### Divine Intervention
* No longer roll a d100, trying to roll below your cleric level, newly rewritten
* As a Magic action, choose any Divine spell of 5th level or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing material components. You then can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Divine Order
* New 1st level feature
* Allows you to choose your "style" of cleric
    * Protector: You gain martial weapon proficiency and heavy armour
    * Thaumaturge: You gain 1 more cleric cantrip and gain a bonus to religion checks equal to your wisdom modifier

#### Greater Divine Intervention
* Replaces d100 roll
* Instead allows cleric to cast Wish, after casting, you must wait 2d4 long rests before using it again.
* When you cast wish in this way, you are immune to the stress caused by using Wish to do something other than casting a spell.

#### Improved Blessed Strikes
* New level 14 feature
* Improves the blessed strikes feature you chose at level 7 
    * Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.
    * Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Divine cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points


#### Smite Undead
* Replaces 5th level destroy undead
* Removed completely destroying creatures based on CR design
* When you use Turn Undead, deal radiant damage equal to your wisdom modifier number of d8s to all creatures who fail, this damage doesn't end the turned condition

#### Spellcasting
* Your spell preparation is now determined by the Spells prepared column in the Cleric Leveling Table
    * It is about how many spells you'd probably have typically as a cleric by prioritizing wisdom at lower levels, but beyond level 11, it is anywhere from 1 to 3 less levels than you'd probably have prepared for a 5e cleric
    * Essentially your prepared spells at lower levels won't change much, but at higher levels it'll be slightly more restricted
    * Its actually the same progression that oneDND bard gets
