* Bard
	* WOTC is smoking crack
	* 3rd level: 
		* Tale of life -> meh / bad
		* Tale of gloam -> ok so steal good parts of rogue subclass
		* Tale of mirth -> just better eloquence bard
	* 6th level:
		* Honestly fine, moonbeam as a BA, w/out spending spell slot is good, also allowing 2d4 healing ain't bad in addition. strong if not fine
	* 14th level:
		* Aboslute crackpot thinking
		* every major boss now has a -1d6 to one saving throw it makes per turn, OR if you cast a healing spell it just adds 1d6.  The healing +1d6 is fine, the tale of mirth is crazy, Treantmonk will say this isn't OP, he's out of his god damned mind like he was last time with this awful take.
* Cleric
	* Ok, cracked at 17th level and removed all the interesting flavor of high level things... thanks
	* 3rd level is fine
		* channel divinty is fine
	* 6th level
		* telepathy is a feat ok I guess
		* replace int check with 16/18/20 is not bad
	* 17 level
		* cool 1 free casting of foresight then only a 6th level spell to cast again.  What the fuck guys
		* AND ITS A BONUS ACTION, ITS NOT EVEN A MAGIC ACTION SO YOU CAN DIVINE FOREKNOWLEDGE AND THEN ACTION CAST A 9TH LEVEL SPELL WHAT THE FUCK
* Fighter
	* Good shit
	* 3rd level cool, get something to do othe than most basic fighter shit
	* 7th level
		* nice, not OP mount that can endlessly fly
		* useful and unique companion
	* 10th
		* Like the rallying stuff, feels team based
	* 15th
		* fly speed is fine here
		* tandem attack is fun
	* 18th level
		* not a bad resistance to have
* Paladin
	* HMMMM, AC Bonus at low level, aura is pretty cracked and insane 20th level which I'm not going to bitch about because other classes get 9th level spells so like, it's good, but paladin's get to have fun too
	* 3rd level
		* Dao's Crush
			* This is just ensnaring strike eh
		* Djinni's Escape
			* kinda neat
		* Efreeti's Fury
			* Eh, ok fine
		* Marid Surge
			* not bad, 15 ft prone push is pretty good
		* Not bad spells, 5th level is kinda cracked tbh
	* [3rd] Genie's Splendor
		* wait what, actually crazy strong
		* assume Dex paladin (why not)
		* at 3rd level
		* shield
		* defense fighting style (or dueling)
		* start ASI: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10 8
		* After Racials 17, 15, 13, 12, 10, 8
		* +3 dex, +2 CHA
		* 4th level becomes +4 dex, + 3 CHA
		* AC 12 + 4 + 3 = 19 + 2 = 21 AC at level 4 w/out any STR requirements.... absolutely nuts, eventually getting to 24 AC if you max CHA and DEX 
		* Ok, what are they on
		* ALso more proficiencies cause why not
	* 7th
		* Holy shit, aura resistance to elemental types is crazy good.  Most aura's are pretty good this is definitely A tier, maybe S.  I'd have to look at others
	* 15th
		* 4d10 reaction to cast hellish rebuke at 3rd level.... OK I guess.  Not bad a bit underwhelming
	* 20th level
		* Flight -> fine
		* Minor Wish -> bruh, if you thought Shen, the atonement cleric from Dracocia which could turn a failure of a damaging spell into a success at the cost of his own failiure was strong (proficiency times per long rest), welcome to once per turn, auto succeed an ally within 30 feet of you. Also, don't forget since most of your allies are in your 30 ft radius, they all most likely succeed so it's not like 3 of your allies are going to need this at once, only one.
		* It's also only a 5th level spell (high for you.. true) BUT STILL in order to recast it
* Ranger
	* 3rd level
		* Frigid Explorer
			* solid +2 to damage all the time, ignore resistances, up to +3 (avg) at levle 11
			* cold resistance is good but not crazy, great in a cold campaign
		* Hunter's Rime
			* like the flavor of not being able to disengage
			* temp hp is nice
		* Spells
			* LETS GO COLD SPELLS
	* 7th level
		* SONG OF REST IS BACK BABY LETS GOOOOO
			* Ok it's a bit better 1d10 + 7 when you get it which is WAYY better than the 1d8 (I think) it'd be
			* But still the meme lives on
			* ALso just better countercharm lmaooo
	* 11th level
		* chiling retribution
			* Not bad, not sure how useful it will be since frightened immunity exists at 11th level but probably useful enough
	* 15th level Frozen Haunt
		* Frozen soul
			* immunity to cold damage -> cool
			* aura of cold of your choosing -> badass
		* partial incorporeal
			* ghostly shit -> love it
		* only 4th level spell to use again, not bad, and it's all part of hunter's mark so no action economy sadness
* Rogue
	* 3rd level
		* Bloodthirst is neat
			* teleport 30 feet is fun and extra damage on bloodied creatures is a new things I haven't seen before
		* Dread Alligeance
			* Like the flavor of this, not too strong but good flavor
	* 9th level
		* terrify is neat
		* Ok, they could've given more than 1 option
	* 13th level
		* Aura of Malevolence
		* Not sure if an extra +1 to +3 is really that good for a 13th level feature tbh
		* ignoring resistance is nice though
			* (don't pick poison though lmaooooo)
	* 17th level
		* Battle tyrant's combo with Terrify is good game design
		* Murderous intent is ok, not amazing, but overall an average of +5 to all sneak attack rolls
		* Honestly not a huge math boon, although +17% damage is good.  It'll also just feel REALLY GOOD to never roll below a 3 on sneak attack damage die.
* Sorcerer
	* 3rd and 6th level are good, (really like 6th level) but it goes a bit over the top later on in terms of tankiness IMO
	* 3rd level
		* spellfire burst
			* bolstering flames
				* a nice little addition to what you're already going to be doing
			* radiant fire
				* 1d6 extra damage a turn you use sorcery points is nice
				* Game design wise this is going to get annoying to constantly be forcing a 2nd saving throw just for 1d6 fire/radiant damage though
		* spells
			* Healing on a sorcerer, heresay I declare
			* Guiding bolt is a good spell, hmmm
			* Aura of vitality could be good
			* Other spells aren't bad
			* Greater Restoration on sorcerer is great utility I dont' hate it
			* ok honestly cure wounds is fine, it's an ok spell.  It's not healing word I won't riot
	* 6th level
		* Absorb spells
			* This is badass as fuck I love it
	* 14th level
		* Honed Spellfire
			* adding +14 (at this level) to the healing is CRAZY good.  armorer artificer, get fucked, this sorcerer is just better than you LMAO. might be a spicy decision to design it like this
			* 3d6 extra damage is nice, and no longer pityful so I don't hate forcing an extra save.  Also if you make it this far, the DM will just be pavlov'd into always rolling for a dex save cause of how many times you'll have used it up until this point
		* Crown of spellfire
			* See like, why is it 7 sorcery points for a sorcerer, which is arguably a huge amount of their usability as a classs, but for other classes they just use something boring like a spell slot
			* 7 sorcery points seems high I'd do 6, or just like an 8th or higher slot to recast
			* Burning Life Force
				* This is definitely good, being able to essentially convert hit die into healing live when you need it is pretty strong
			* Flight
				* Everybody's gotta fly I guess
			* Spell avoidance
				* evasion on spell /magical effects
				* This is going to make this sorcerer extremely tanky.  Some tankiness I like, but with honed spellfire and burning life force this might be getting a bit too much for my taste
* Wizard
	* Cause of course we have to have a wizard subclass in everything
	* Overall: it's not really much of a buff, but idk why they needed medium armour feels unnecessary.
	* 3rd level
		* switched Number of uses to INT mod instead of proficiency bonus
		* Wasn't part of the design change to move away from mods and instead use prof bonus to stop people feeling like they needed to rush their primary or secondary ability score higher?
			* Feels like WotC can't make a decision and stick with it
	* 3rd level
		* Medium armor proficiency is added.  Ok, make it even easier for them to have high AC I guess, fuckin 15 AC w/ medium + 2 from dex + 5 from int, ok, we cooking at 22 AC as a bladesinger no problemo... totally don't hate that at all
	* 6th level
		* same as before, it's fine
	* 10th level
		* same, its good
	* 14th level
		* BA attack after action leveled spell is pretty alright tbh, nothing crazy
