### Weapon Masteries
* All weapons now have mastery properties
TODO: ADD TABLE HERE OR CLEANED UP IMAGE

#### Heavy Weapon Property
A Heavy weapon is unwieldy compared to other
weapons. You have Disadvantage on your attack
rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon
and your Strength score isn’t at least 13, and if
it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score
isn’t at least 13.

#### Light Weapon Property
When you take the Attack action on your turn
and attack with a Light weapon, you can make
one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the
same turn. That extra attack must be made with
a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your
ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage,
unless that modifier is negative.
For example, if you take the Attack action on
your turn and have a Shortsword in one hand
and a Dagger in the other—each of which has the
Light property—you can make one attack with
each weapon using your action and a Bonus
Action, but you don’t add your Strength or
Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the
Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

#### Thrown Weapon Property
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack.
If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same
ability modifier for that attack roll and damage
roll that you would use for a melee attack with
the weapon. For example, if you throw a
Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw
a Dagger, you can use either your Strength or
your Dexterity since the Dagger has the Finesse
property.

#### Cleave Mastery Property
*Prereq: Heavy melee weapon*
If you hit a creature with a melee attack using
this weapon, you can make an attack roll with
the weapon against a second creature within 5
feet of the first that is also within your reach. On
a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s
damage, but don’t add your ability modifier to
that damage unless that modifier is negative. You
can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Graze Mastery Property
*Prereq: Heavy melee weapon*
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a
creature, you can deal damage to that creature
equal to the ability modifier you used to make
the attack roll. This damage is the same type
dealt by the weapon, and the damage can’t be
increased in any way, other than increasing the
ability modifier.

#### Nick Mastery Property
*Prereq: light weapon*
When you make the extra attack of the Light
property, you can make it as part of the Attack
action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can
make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Push Mastery Property
*Prerequisite: Heavy, Two-Handed, or Versatile Property*
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can
push the creature up to 10 feet straight away
from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

#### Sap Mastery Property
*Prerequisite: Versatile Property or No Weapon Property*
If you hit a creature with this weapon, that
creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll
before the start of your next turn.

#### Slow Mastery Property
*Prerequisite: None*
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal
damage to the creature, you can reduce its Speed
by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If you
hit the creature more than once with this
property, the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10
feet.

#### Topple Mastery Property
*Prerequisite: Heavy, Reach, or Versatile Property*
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can
force the creature to make a Constitution saving
throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency
Bonus + the ability modifier used to make the
attack roll. On a failed save, the creature has the
Prone condition.

#### Vex Mastery Property
*Prerequisite: Ammunition, Finesse, or Light Property8
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal
damage to the creature, you have Advantage on
your next attack roll against that creature before
the end of your next turn.
